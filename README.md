# Hi, I'm Gary

I'm a crusader against mediocrity, imbiber of vino, junkie of technology, student of the 6-string,  lover of the roar of an American V8, and a US Expat.

Professionally, I guide our products at [Dovetail Software](https://dovetailsoftware.com), where we focus on HR Case Management and Clarify/Amdocs CRM apps.
